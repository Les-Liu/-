# Research on Improving Quality and Efficiency of Typical Gathering and Transportation Transfer Stations in Jilin Oilfield
There is a problem of high energy consumption in the transfer station of the ground engineering system in Jilin Oilfield. By analyzing the main workflow of the transfer station，the proportion of energy consumption in each process is calculated，and the main reason for the high energy consumption in the transfer station is found to be the high energy consumption of the heating furnace. Therefore，the outlet temperature of the heating furnace is adjusted to reduce the energy consumption of the heating furnace，and finally achieve the lowest energy consumption of the transfer station. Through optimizing calculations，when the outlet temperatures of the heating furnace in winter and summer export processes at Hai 118 Transfer Station are 43.8 ℃ and 37.2 ℃，respectively，and the outlet temperatures of the heating furnace in winter and summer blending processes are 51 ℃ and 44 ℃，respectively，the energy consumption of the transfer station is the lowest throughout the year， reducing the use of 307 tons of carbon per year. When the outlet temperatures of the heating furnace in the winter and summer export processes at Xinmin 6 Transfer Station are 44.4 ℃ and 44.2 ℃ ， respectively， and the outlet temperatures of the heating furnace in the winter and summer blending processes are 54.5 ℃ and 49.5 ℃ ， respectively， the energy consumption of the transfer station is the lowest throughout the year，reducing the use of 375 tons of carbon per year. When the outlet temperatures of the heating furnace in the winter and summer export processes at Rang 47 Transfer Station are 47.9 ℃ and 46.6 ℃ ，respectively，and the outlet temperatures of the heating furnace in the winter and summer blending processes are 57 ℃ and 56 ℃ ， respectively， the energy consumption of the transfer station is the lowest throughout the year，reducing the use of 333 tons of carbon per year.
